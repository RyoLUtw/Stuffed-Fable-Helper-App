      "The ride afforded time to observe the lands of the Fall. The scenery shifted, yet the sickly sky held. On the horizon, a false dawn burned violet. Farther on, a pile-studded plain fell away and the track bent into trees that has little resemblance to home, their limbs weaving a tunnel. A winding bridge carried them over a river where strangers drifted on a raft."
