      "“Mpff!” cried a voice, and you discover your foot on a rocking horse’s face, half buried in trash. “Bless my buttons!” you exclaimed. “Sorry, old fellow.” “Don’t bother,” the horse replied with a sigh. “One rocker’s gone. That’s why my girl forgot me.” You wave the others over, hope rising if tools could set him right."
