      "The stuffies wandered through the forest until they spotted a tiny playhouse sitting alone among the trees. Its frame looked broken-down and oddly shaped, as if it had been forgotten for a long time. They stepped closer for a careful inspection, hoping for a way inside. But when they tried the door, it proved to be locked and surprisingly sturdy. With no other choice, they prepared to move on."
